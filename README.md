# Java-OOP
-Here are all the labs and exercises I've completed as part of the Java-OOP course provided by SoftUni.

- The Java OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. We will pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
